/**
 * &lt;p&gt;A payment channel is a method of sending money to someone such that the amount of money you send can be adjusted
 * after the fact, in an efficient manner that does not require broadcasting to the network. This can be used to
 * implement micropayments or other payment schemes in which immediate settlement is not required, but zero trust
 * negotiation is. Note that this class only allows the amount of money received to be incremented, not decremented.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There are two subclasses that implement this one, for versions 1 and 2 of the protocol -
 * {@link PaymentChannelV1ServerState} and {@link PaymentChannelV2ServerState}.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class implements the core state machine for the server side of the protocol. The client side is implemented
 * by {@link PaymentChannelV1ClientState} and {@link PaymentChannelServerListener} implements the server-side network
 * protocol listening for TCP/IP connections and moving this class through each state. We say that the party who is
 * sending funds is the &lt;i&gt;client&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;initiating party&lt;/i&gt;. The party that is receiving the funds is the
 * &lt;i&gt;server&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;receiving party&lt;/i&gt;. Although the underlying Bitcoin protocol is capable of more complex
 * relationships than that, this class implements only the simplest case.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To protect clients from malicious servers, a channel has an expiry parameter. When this expiration is reached, the
 * client will broadcast the created refund  transaction and take back all the money in this channel. Because this is
 * specified in terms of block timestamps, it is fairly fuzzy and it is possible to spend the refund transaction up to a
 * few hours before the actual timestamp. Thus, it is very important that the channel be closed with plenty of time left
 * to get the highest value payment transaction confirmed before the expire time (minimum 3-4 hours is suggested if the
 * payment transaction has enough fee to be confirmed in the next block or two).&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To begin, we must provide the client with a pubkey which we wish to use for the multi-sig contract which locks in
 * the channel. The client will then provide us with an incomplete refund transaction and the pubkey which they used in
 * the multi-sig contract. We use this pubkey to recreate the multi-sig output and then sign that to the refund
 * transaction. We provide that signature to the client and they then have the ability to spend the refund transaction
 * at the specified expire time. The client then provides us with the full, signed multi-sig contract which we verify
 * and broadcast, locking in their funds until we spend a payment transaction or the expire time is reached. The client
 * can then begin paying by providing us with signatures for the multi-sig contract which pay some amount back to the
 * client, and the rest is ours to do with as we wish.&lt;/p&gt;
