/**
 * &lt;p&gt;A KeyChain is a class that stores a collection of keys for a {@link org.bitcoinj.wallet.Wallet}. Key chains
 * are expected to be able to look up keys given a hash (i.e. address) or pubkey bytes, and provide keys on request
 * for a given purpose. They can inform event listeners about new keys being added.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;However it is important to understand what this interface does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; provide. It cannot encrypt or decrypt
 * keys, for instance you need an implementor of {@link EncryptableKeyChain}. It cannot have keys imported into it,
 * that you to use a method of a specific key chain instance, such as {@link BasicKeyChain}. The reason for these
 * restrictions is to support key chains that may be handled by external hardware or software, or which are derived
 * deterministically from a seed (and thus the notion of importing a key is meaningless).&lt;/p&gt;
