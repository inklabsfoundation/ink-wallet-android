/**
 * &lt;p&gt;An AbstractBlockChain holds a series of {@link Block} objects, links them together, and knows how to verify that
 * the chain follows the rules of the {@link NetworkParameters} for this chain.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;It can be connected to a {@link Wallet}, and also {@link TransactionReceivedInBlockListener}s that can receive transactions and
 * notifications of re-organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;An AbstractBlockChain implementation must be connected to a {@link BlockStore} implementation. The chain object
 * by itself doesn't store any data, that's delegated to the store. Which store you use is a decision best made by
 * reading the getting started guide, but briefly, fully validating block chains need fully validating stores. In
 * the lightweight SPV mode, a {@link org.bitcoinj.store.SPVBlockStore} is the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class implements an abstract class which makes it simple to create a BlockChain that does/doesn't do full
 * verification.  It verifies headers and is implements most of what is required to implement SPV mode, but
 * also provides callback hooks which can be used to do full verification.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There are two subclasses of AbstractBlockChain that are useful: {@link BlockChain}, which is the simplest
 * class and implements &lt;i&gt;simplified payment verification&lt;/i&gt;. This is a lightweight and efficient mode that does
 * not verify the contents of blocks, just their headers. A {@link FullPrunedBlockChain} paired with a
 * {@link org.bitcoinj.store.H2FullPrunedBlockStore} implements full verification, which is equivalent to
 * Bitcoin Core. To learn more about the alternative security models, please consult the articles on the
 * website.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;b&gt;Theory&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The 'chain' is actually a tree although in normal operation it operates mostly as a list of {@link Block}s.
 * When multiple new head blocks are found simultaneously, there are multiple stories of the economy competing to become
 * the one true consensus. This can happen naturally when two miners solve a block within a few seconds of each other,
 * or it can happen when the chain is under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A reference to the head block of the best known chain is stored. If you can reach the genesis block by repeatedly
 * walking through the prevBlock pointers, then we say this is a full chain. If you cannot reach the genesis block
 * we say it is an orphan chain. Orphan chains can occur when blocks are solved and received during the initial block
 * chain download, or if we connect to a peer that doesn't send us blocks in order.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A reorganize occurs when the blocks that make up the best known chain changes. Note that simply adding a
 * new block to the top of the best chain isn't as reorganize, but that a reorganize is always triggered by adding
 * a new block that connects to some other (non best head) block. By &quot;best&quot; we mean the chain representing the largest
 * amount of work done.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Every so often the block chain passes a difficulty transition point. At that time, all the blocks in the last
 * 2016 blocks are examined and a new difficulty target is calculated from them.&lt;/p&gt;
