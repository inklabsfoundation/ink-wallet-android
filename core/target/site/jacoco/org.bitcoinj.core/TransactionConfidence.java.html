/**
 * &lt;p&gt;A TransactionConfidence object tracks data you can use to make a confidence decision about a transaction.
 * It also contains some pre-canned rules for common scenarios: if you aren't really sure what level of confidence
 * you need, these should prove useful. You can get a confidence object using {@link Transaction#getConfidence()}.
 * They cannot be constructed directly.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Confidence in a transaction can come in multiple ways:&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Because you created it yourself and only you have the necessary keys.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Receiving it from a fully validating peer you know is trustworthy, for instance, because it's run by yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Receiving it from a peer on the network you randomly chose. If your network connection is not being
 *     intercepted, you have a pretty good chance of connecting to a node that is following the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Receiving it from multiple peers on the network. If your network connection is not being intercepted,
 *     hearing about a transaction from multiple peers indicates the network has accepted the transaction and
 *     thus miners likely have too (miners have the final say in whether a transaction becomes valid or not).&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Seeing the transaction appear appear in a block on the main chain. Your confidence increases as the transaction
 *     becomes further buried under work. Work can be measured either in blocks (roughly, units of time), or
 *     amount of work done.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you may know that the transaction is &quot;dead&quot;, that is, one or more of its inputs have
 * been double spent and will never confirm unless there is another re-org.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;TransactionConfidence is updated via the {@link org.bitcoinj.core.TransactionConfidence#incrementDepthInBlocks()}
 * method to ensure the block depth is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
 * To make a copy that won't be changed, use {@link org.bitcoinj.core.TransactionConfidence#duplicate()}.
