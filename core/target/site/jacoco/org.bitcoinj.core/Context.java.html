// TODO: Finish adding Context c'tors to all the different objects so we can start deprecating the versions that take NetworkParameters.
// TODO: Add a working directory notion to Context and make various subsystems that want to use files default to that directory (eg. Orchid, block stores, wallet, etc).
// TODO: Auto-register the block chain object here, and then use it in the (newly deprecated) TransactionConfidence.getDepthInBlocks() method: the new version should take an AbstractBlockChain specifically.
//       Also use the block chain object reference from the context in PeerGroup and remove the other constructors, as it's easy to forget to wire things up.
// TODO: Move Threading.USER_THREAD to here and leave behind just a source code stub. Allow different instantiations of the library to use different user threads.
// TODO: Keep a URI to where library internal data files can be found, to abstract over the lack of JAR files on Android.
// TODO: Stash anything else that resembles global library configuration in here and use it to clean up the rest of the API without breaking people.

 * &lt;p&gt;The Context object holds various objects and pieces of configuration that are scoped to a specific instantiation of
 * bitcoinj for a specific network. You can get an instance of this class through calling {@link #get()}.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Context is new in 0.13 and the library is currently in a transitional period: you should create a Context that
 * wraps your chosen network parameters before using the rest of the library. However if you don't, things will still
 * work as a Context will be created for you and stashed in thread local storage. The context is then propagated between
 * library created threads as needed. This automagical propagation and creation is a temporary mechanism: one day it
 * will be removed to avoid confusing edge cases that could occur if the developer does not fully understand it e.g.
 * in the case where multiple instances of the library are in use simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
